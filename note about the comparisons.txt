Every "source" screenshot came from a clip loaded the same way as a "filtered" screenshot, with the exception of:
-almost all of the filterchain is missing for obvious reasons
-they only include TIVTC+Decimation as used for Filtered screenshots, or Yadif2x instead of QTGMC. This was needed to maintain frame number consistency, especially with yadif being a simple but double rate deinterlacer
-the aspect ratio correction is performed with BilinearResize(), instead of a much better nnedi3_resize16. This difference is probably the cause of the biggest noticeable diff between versions in "kai-AB01-022878"
-there is also no point in doing the "Source" with more than 8 bits of precision since there is nothing much happening, so that was removed too

Essentially the "Source".AVS would look like this
LWLibavAudioSource("vid",threads=2, prefer_hw=1)
TFM, TDecimate and Vinverse the same way, or Yadifmod2(mode=3)



I've also included older versions of the scripts. I didn't have an older version of the exact same script for the animation example (kai-AB01 or kai-OP01), but nontheless should show give a good idea of an older script for the same content
